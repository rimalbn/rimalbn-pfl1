                <h2>Hello There, I am Bipran üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíªü•ä</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I‚Äôm Bipran Rimal ‚Äî a sophomore at the University of Cincinnati, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity. My journey has been shaped by an unwavering dedication to academic excellence and a deep-rooted passion for martial arts, where discipline and resilience have become second nature.
                <br> <br> With a strong foundation in cybersecurity, I‚Äôm driven by a curiosity to understand the digital world at its core. My interests span across multiple domains of technology, including database management, where I explore the art of structuring and securing data efficiently; web development, where I craft interactive and user-friendly digital experiences; system administration, ensuring smooth and secure operations of IT infrastructures; and computer networking and security, where I delve into building and protecting networks from ever-evolving threats.
                <br> <br> Whether it's designing secure systems, managing critical data, or safeguarding digital environments, I thrive on challenges that demand both technical acumen and strategic thinking. Through every project and opportunity, I aim to merge my technical skills with my warrior mindset ‚Äî disciplined, focused, and always evolving.
